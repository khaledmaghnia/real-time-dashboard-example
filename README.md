## Special thanks to

1. [tornado-websocket-example](https://github.com/hiroakis/tornado-websocket-example), an amazing repo to bring you to websocket with tornado.
2. [Getting Started With Django Channels](https://realpython.com/blog/python/getting-started-with-django-channels/), a solid post to get you started with Django Channels, though it's cumbersome to configure Django to run with websocket for the moment. I ended up giving up and turned to tornado instead.
